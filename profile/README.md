## Hi there 👋

Stringboot is a lightweight SDK for Android, iOS, and Web that makes app copy dynamic by default.
Instead of hardcoding strings and shipping releases for small changes, you add one line where the string is declared and manage everything at runtime. Teams use it for contextual FAQs, live A B testing on copy, and adding new languages instantly.
